Exercise: Will printing this expression result in bottom?

1. No, because snd doesn't evaluate the first argument.
2. Yes, because in order to y get evaluated, it requires evaluating 1, which
   forces the evaluation of x, which is undefined.
3. Yes, because the cons operator needs to evaluate the outer structure of the
   right hand side, but it's undefined.
4. No, because length only cares about the outer structure, and not its contents.
5. No, because const doesn't evaluate the second argument.
6. Same as above. Const doesn't evaluate 1, and so doesn't evaluate undefined.
7. Yes, because const evaluates its first parameter, so undefined is evaluated.
